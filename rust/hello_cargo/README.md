# Cargo
This tool is installed by default for rust if we installed rust via the official installers .
It likes npm of nodejs, go module of Golang

## Cargo build
This command creates an executable file in target/debug/hello_cargo (or target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows) rather than in your current directoryectory
## Cargo run
This command will build and run the execuatable file
## Cargo check
Cargo also provides a command called cargo check. This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesnâ€™t produce an executable. It is much faster then `build` command
